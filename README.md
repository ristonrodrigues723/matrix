Project Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a web-based visualization of advanced data structure concepts using matrices. The application allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize matrices, along with performing various operations on them.

Features:

Matrix Input: Users can enter matrices as comma-separated values, with semicolons separating rows.
Random Matrix Generation: Generates random matrices of specified dimensions.
Element Manipulation: Users can add or remove elements from a matrix by specifying the row, column, and value.
Matrix Operations:
Highlights the main and secondary diagonals.
Transposes the matrix.
Rotates the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
Visual Representation: The matrix is visually displayed, allowing users to observe the changes made.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data structure manipulations, and visual updates.
Getting Started:
